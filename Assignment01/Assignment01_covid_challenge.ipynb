    "This simple set of assignments will help you to assess your Python programming skills. Try to solve the individual problems without searching for a solution online but basing your coding exclusively on your skills.

    "\n",
    "This dataset contains data about the processing of COVID-19 sequences by different countries over time. It comes as a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file. This file contains the following 6 columns:\n",

    "1. `location`: the country for which the information is provided\n",
    "2. `date`: the date of the data entry\n",
    "3. `variant`: the COVID-19 variant for the data entry\n",
    "4. `num_sequences`: the number of sequences **processed** (for the country, variant, and date)\n",
    "5. `num_sequences_total`: the number of sequences **available** (for the country, variant, and date)\n",
    "6. `perc_sequences`: the percentage of available number of sequences that were processed (*Note: this value is out of 100*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset represents the processing of *one* variant by *one* country on *one* day."
